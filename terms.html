<h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Hide N Match Terms and Conditions of Use</strong></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is a contract between you and the GeeksBuild, Inc. (as defined further below) and sets forth yours and our rights before you use the Hide N Match application ("App"). Please take a few moments to read these Terms before enjoying the App. Once you access, view or use the App, you will be legally bound by these Terms.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>1.

You can create an Account via 3rd party email accounts like Google/Apple. We do not collect anything more than email to identify you from your social accounts. For more information about what information we use and how we use it, please check out our Privacy Policy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While we value inclusivity, we cannot allow you to use another person's Account without permission. You can delete your Account at any time by going to the 'Settings' page when you are logged in and clicking on the 'Delete account' link. Your Account will be deleted immediately but it may take a little while for Your Content (defined below) to be completely removed from the App. We will save your profile information in case you decide to restore your Account (which you can do within 30 days of deactivating your Account). If you delete your Account and try to create a new account within this time period using the same credentials, we will re-activate your Account for you. We reserve the right at our sole discretion to terminate or suspend any Account, or make use of any operational, technological, legal or other means available to enforce the Terms (including without limitation blocking specific IP addresses), at any time without liability and without the need to give you prior notice.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may not access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the App or our systems.
